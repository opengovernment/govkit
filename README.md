# Govkit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opengovernment/govkit.png)](http://travis-ci.org/opengovernment/govkit)

Govkit is a Ruby gem that provides simple access to US open government APIs around the web, including:

 *  [OpenCongress](http://www.opencongress.org/api), which has an API for federal bills, votes, people, and news and blog coverage
 *  [The Open States project](http://fiftystates-dev.sunlightlabs.com/), which has a RESTful API for accessing data about state legislators, bills, votes, etc.
 *  [Project Vote Smart](http://www.votesmart.org/services_api.php), which has an API with congressional addresses, etc.
 *  [Follow The Money](http://www.followthemoney.org/), whose API reveals campaign contribution data for state officials.
 *  [TransparencyData API](http://transparencydata.com/api) (campaign contributions only)

# Installation

From gemcutter:

    gem install govkit

# Setup

Add govkit to your environment.rb or Gemfile

Run <code>rails generate govkit</code> (Rails 3.x) or <code>script/generate govkit</code> (Rails 2.x) to copy a config file into <code>config/initializers/govkit.rb</code>. You will need to add your API keys to this config file.

Outside of Rails you can configure your API keys like so:

    >> GovKit.configure do |config|
    >>   config.sunlight_apikey   = 'YOUR_SUNLIGHT_API_KEY'
    >>   config.votesmart_apikey  = 'YOUR_VOTESMART_API_KEY'
    >>   config.ftm_apikey        = 'YOUR_FTM_API_KEY'
    >> end

# Usage Examples

    >> GovKit::OpenStates::State.find_by_abbreviation('CA')
    >> GovKit::VoteSmart::Address.find(votesmart_candidate_id)
    >> GovKit::OpenCongress::Bill.find(:number => 5479, :type => 'h', :congress => '111')

Objects returned from GovKit will have attributes for each field coming back from the API:

    >> x = GovKit::OpenStates::State.find_by_abbreviation('CA')
    => #<GovKit::OpenStates::State:0x00000100f6a5a8 @attributes={"lower_chamber_title"=>"Assemblymember", "lower_chamber_name"=>"Assembly", "upper_chamber_title"=>"Senator", "terms"=>[#<GovKit::OpenStates::State::Term:0x00000100f2a8e0 @attributes={"....
    >> x.name
    => "California"

GovKit will raise GovKit::ResourceNotFound if a requested item isn't available.

# Testing & Debugging

For debugging purposes, there's a raw_response reader provided for each object, which typically returns an HTTParty::Response object. To see the body of the HTTP response, you might look here:

    (continuing the example from above)
    >> x.raw_response.response.body
    => "{\n    \"lower_chamber_title\": \"Assemblymember\", \n    \"lower_chamber_name\": \"Assembly\", \n  ....

# Dear Canadians

For Canadian open government data, our friends up north have created a [govkit-ca](https://github.com/jpmckinney/govkit-ca) gem that lives in the GovKit::CA namespace and should interoperate just fine with this gem.

# A GovKit for your country?

Let us know if you'd like to build a govkit for your region! We'd love to link to you. Your gem should be called, for example, govkit-uk (ISO 3166 country code), and your methods should live in the GovKit::GB namespace (for example).
